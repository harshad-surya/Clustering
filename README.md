# Clustering

Description: HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes. After the recent funding programs, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid.

Business Goal: We need to categories using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country and also need to suggest the countries using ML clustering algorithms for which we need to project to management which needs to be focused on the most.
